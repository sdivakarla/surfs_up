# Surf's Up

W.Avy, a client in Oahu, is planning to start a surf shop and needs to know the temperature range year-round.  Using SQL Alchemy, a weather dataset from Hawaii can be filtered to look at temperatures in June and December.  

# Overview

The weather stations in Oahu are collecting temperatures multiple times a day.  In order to understand the typical temperatures in different months, the readings were filtered for two selected months, June and December. Then the readings for those temperatures could be evaluated with standard summary statistics.  The statistics that were determined include: count, mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum and percentiles. For W. Avy to determine if the weather is amenable to a year-round surf shop he needs to know the temperature ranges. 

# Results 

1. June Temperature Data - There were 1700 readings collected in the month of June with an average temperature of 74.9 degrees Farenheit.
